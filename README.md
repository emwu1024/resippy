# Resippy Repository

This project is a repository for recipes I have previously made so I can remember that these recipes exist for longer than a month at a time :)

## Stack

- npm
- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- Node
- Express
- Postgresql

## Running The Application

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the 'resippy' folder (otherwise known as the client folder).
2. Run `npm run dev`

### Backend

1. Navigate to the 'server' folder.
2. Run `npm run dev`

## Findings Log

1. If I want to store high quality photos's on MongoDB I will need to use something called GridFS: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gridfs-making-file-uploading-to-mongodb/
2. Was encountering issues running the backend. Fixed by whitelisting IP address of new working location ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Work Log

1. Currently implementing the routes in recipesRoute.js file.
